# zapit-CAD

Zapit is a random-access spatio-temporally precise scanning system for optogenetics experiments. The following consists of resources on the parts used, CAD models for their construction and instructions for assembly. See here for the paper (), and here for the main page (https://github.com/Zapit-Optostim)

There are two construction routes.
One is to make everything out of ThorLabs parts.
The second is to use our CAD model to machine a compact custom enclosure.
See the [Parts List](Parts_List.md) for a list of parts required. 
We are keen to help others build the system, so if you feel you lack information please make contact via GitHub and we will get you up and running.
